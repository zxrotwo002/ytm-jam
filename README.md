# Credits

Python code and javascript is written by me  
The bridge server was also written by me  
  
CSS was generated by Gemini  
The tampermonkey script was also generated by Gemini since my first idea was to use the YTM-Desktop app as player until i realised that it doesn't support adding songs to the queue.
